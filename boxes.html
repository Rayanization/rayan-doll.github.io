Behind this human façade lays a great deal of story. My story starts with my name. My name is Rayan. Rayan means, “quenching the thirst,” in Arabic&#8212after severe deprivation, satisfying the thirst, desire, and passion of desiccation. Our names have a direct impact on our personal lives&#8212who we are, our declaration, family history, our beliefs, the morals we abide by, our homes, cultures, and transformations. We aren’t asking for their story, if we aren’t asking for their name.</span></h3>

                        <h3 class="p-center">My name reflects on my young self, the desire to learn, discover, question, discuss, explore and finding the truth. Growing up in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, I had many larger than life questions to ask: questions about God, faith, heaven & hell, traditions, humanity, peace, war, love, fear, life and the afterlife. These were heavy questions coming from a kid’s mouth starting with the letter W: why, when, what and where, and the letter H, how?</h3>
                        <h3 class="p-center">Whether it is fortunate or unfortunate, I never received logical answers to my questions. Instead, I was asked to simply be silent, to not think about these questions because not all questions could possibly have answers. When I kept asking similar questions, I was told if I continued asking I would end up burning in hell fire in the afterlife. </h3>
                        <h3 class="p-center">As a result, at a young age, I was taught not to ask, question, or doubt. Simply, I had to follow the same traditions millions of people with my background have followed for thousands of years. Because my intentions were very innocent, I never wanted to be problematic, wanting eagerly to be the best son, for my family to be proud of me, I learned to observe in complete silence. I allowed everyone else to live my life for me. I allowed society to create me, to mold into the shape and size they liked, to control me. At that time, the Rayan Doll’s were manufactured and packaged by society in several doll boxes. Silent, submissive, obedient, and brainwashed dolls. Over the course of a few decades, the Rayan Doll’s were trapped in these solid boxes, imaginary prisons, and formed their stories.</h3></div>

                            <p class="para p-left"><em>I was raised to fear God. But God is the savior? Why the need to fear God? Is this God so enraged that we need to fear him? Does this mean that God has human-like emotions? God is within all of us? Are we God? Where does God live? In the sky? Then why can I not see God? Where did God come from? How did God create us? Why did God create us? To worship God?  Why can I not talk to him? Oh, I have to pray to talk to him? Why does God not talk back to me? Oh he does, I just cannot hear him?</em> <br><br>I questioned further. Who is this God I followed? Why does he make me angry? How does God benefit me? Do I believe in God?</p>
                            <p class="para p-left">These questions were on my conscience, throbbing in the back of my deepest thoughts. I kept these questions to myself, fearing God would throw me in hell fire in the afterlife. But what is God? And who is God for real? I wonder what a good pronoun to use to call God? Is God a “he” or a “she”, or “it? I wonder what faith really is? What does it mean to blindly believe in something or someone that we cannot see or feel? Having faith in something that is intangible is difficult to grasp. I have never hated God. But I have hated to be forced to loving him. To be forced to obey and live the rules that come with having a faith in God. </p>
                            <p class="para p-left">When I was a young kind, I tried to fit in with my religiously strict Islamic circles of friends and family members (society). I went to the mosque and prayed every daily prayer. I fasted from sunrise to sunset the entire month of Ramadan every year from the age of seven. I wanted to force myself to be religious enough to be able to convince myself that God is the greatest. I practiced Islam with due diligence. I failed to convince myself of the existence of this God I worshipped, my faith in God gradually departed. Still, I wanted to make my family proud of me, I wanted to make friends with other kids and not to be judged, labeled as a sinner. You see, in Saudi Arabia, no matter who you are and what you do, whether you were a strict religious Muslim (30% of Saudis are strictly religious), or culturally Muslim (70%), you must have faith in God—if you do not, you are an outsider, you are a stranger, you are an infidel.</p>
                            <p class="para p-left">Years later, I realized that God is nothing but a concept created by mankind. I concluded, they needed someone to blame, someone to beg and talk to, someone to give them a purpose in life. I began believing our ancestors created religion—the constitutions and the rules of God—written in a book, to prevent people from committing immoral sins (killing, raping, stealing, cheating, lying, etc.). About two thousand years ago, at a time when people didn’t have rules to go by, and were living unruled, just like residing in jungle full of untamed animals needing to be tamed and leashed, to be kept in check and begin using their given brain. Creating a religion for people to fear a higher power that cannot be seen was a great development to control those living two thousand years ago.</p>
                            <p class="para p-left">Before the introduction of Islam, society was unruly and out of control. The unruly society had demons embedded within them that disallowed them to differentiate between moral and immoral habits. Humans used to hunt other humans (eating human meat to survive) when they failed to find a prey (animals) to hunt and eat. Society was disorderly, society needed order. Religion brought order to society by differentiating between moral and immoral habits. Religion leashed their inner demons, creating order.</p>
                            <p class="para p-left">The definition of “life” is not any different than two thousand years ago. “Life” remains unchanged by description. Society changes as time progresses. The same inner demons that people had two millennia ago, still exist within every individual today. These demons, primal instincts, remain leashed because of the progression of society. What differentiates today’s humanity from that of two thousand years ago are the morals embedded within society through progression. A moral person abides by the law, the principles created by human beings through the creation of religion. A moral person does not murder, rape, steal, cheat, etc. An immoral individual is unable to control his demons, commits inhumane crimes, often ending up in prison.</p>
                            <p class="para p-left">Today, religion is abused and used to awaken those demons, those primal instincts. Religion has failed to function and cannot perform its original purpose: to keep society tamed and abide by moral laws. Forcing people to follow a certain religion, (just because they were born in a community where people practiced that religion) is a mind rape. Mind raping occurs when one feels viciously assaulted, mentally, by an event or reality. Unfortunately, people who belong to strict religions (live within religiously strict society) experience consistent mind rape.</p>
                            <p class="para p-left">Muslims believe every new born child is born Muslim. Later, they convert to their family’s religion (a non-Muslim family). This concept does not make sense to me. When a child is born, he is born one-hundred percent, a free-thinking human being. The minute the child’s family converts them, they become ninety-nine percent free-thinking and one percent imprisoned. The greater the role of religion in a child’s life, the less free-thinking and more brained washed they become. Today, religion is wielded by powerful individuals as a tool to manipulate those who are imprisoned by it. Religion has ceased to connect me with a higher power. Rather, religion is the harbinger of fear, anxiety, and torture.</p>

                            <p class="para p-right">Born in a culturally strict society, there are certain rules and laws—referred to as traditions—that need to be followed. To declare your true Saudiism, you must follow these viciously aggressive traditions. Following Saudi tradition, opens the doors of acceptance within society. The same doors of acceptance are closed if you do not follow. Born to Saudi parents and by practicing Saudiism thoroughly, I learned to follow tradition. Saudis have great pride in their culture and tradition. To the point where culture can be in serious competition with religion itself. The pride in a Bedouin cultural background blinds most Saudis and inhibits them from seeing clearly. Tradition is the measurement scale that Saudis use to value everything. Once again, tradition is the ancestral practices, passed down generation to generation. I often wonder why? Why do we still take tradition so seriously and live life by tradition? People evolve, mature, transform and become wiser through time, changing tradition through the process. I appreciate some traditions, and I consider them to be life lessons I learn from. But I cannot worship those traditions and dutifully follow all of them. These traditions were practiced and worked at the time, but they do not work with today’s society.</p>
                            <p class="para p-right">To understand what I am explaining you must know a little bit about Saudi Arabia. Saudi Arabia lacks a public space. Males and females are segregated from an early age. The segregation is found in schools, universities, shops, coffee places, etc.  Until this day Saudi Arabia does not have a movie theater, fearing that men and women are not supposed to be kept alone in a dark room side-by-side. Throughout my school years, I went to an all-boy schools. It wasn’t a decision my family made, but it was made by culture itself and forced upon us. In Saudi, women are considered second-class, lesser, weak, sensitive and fragile. A man is culturally allowed to marry multiple wives, but a woman cannot do the same. A man can freely travel, but a woman cannot (without the acceptance/permission from her male guardian.) Females cannot drive vehicles, only men can. A man is the one who proposes, a woman cannot. A woman’s virginity is a big deal and if she does retain her virgin status before marriage, she is not considered a full woman, left with little to no respect. This has never made sense to me. I am not a woman, so I cannot fully comprehend the feelings a Saudi woman experiences. But I am surrounded by women in my inner circle (family members) with whom I can relate these feelings to. If you read through the Islamic scriptures a female is not considered less than a man, but rather, his partner. Saudi tradition says otherwise. Now I am dealing with a confused society that does not know were religion starts and tradition ends.</p>

                            <p class="para p-left"> There exists no word in the human language that expresses the amount of unconditional love I carry in my heart for my family. The sort of love that can be equivalent to worship. My family exhibits the same sort of love towards me, no matter how much I upset them.  I always have a reserved room in their thoughts, hearts, and in their arms. But, a love like that can be fatal. Saudi families are culturally raised to be family oriented. Family comes first, the circumstances do not matter.</p>
                            <p class="para p-left">Saudi families help their kids financially though out their life until they graduate from college and start a career of their own. However, this financial privilege comes with a price. It is a tool designed to control their children. If the kid does not follow the rules of their household, the financial help will halt. A kid would be less than smart to refuse financial stability over personal freedom.</p>
                            <p class="para p-left">The flow of finances that come from my family is not a free loan. This loan is paid off once I meet all the criteria in my family’s book. As member of my family, I cannot independently move out the family home, after graduating high school at the age of 18. My situation is different because I did move away, temporarily, for educational purposes. I constantly question, why do I have to be living with my family? I am an adult, a grown man. Why can I not make my own decisions?</p>
                            <p class="para p-left">A child is only allowed to move out once they choose to settle down and establish a family of their own. What if I never want to get married? Will I have to permanently live with my family for the rest of my life? If I decide to marry, my family plays a large role in the decision making. My marriage will, more than likely, be an arranged marriage, mimicking a business deal. My future spouse, must pass the test, adhere to my family’s standards. She must come from a “good” family, along with a “good standing” reputation. The human emotions are lost in this transaction. Where are the human emotions? Why am I not the sole decision maker? Is this not my future? Is not this my life?</p>

As amazing as the feat was, I did not understand the reason Americans were so happy to refer him as “the first black president.” I thought being an American was holding an American passport, not that a person’s race determines their identity. I did not know race was a big deal. I knew that United States was established based on the idea of immigration, a melting pot of different people from different backgrounds. I thought America did not have one uniquely identified culture, but instead had many different cultures mixed together so beautifully. I did not understand how the color of one’s skin could prevent one from becoming President of the United States of America.</p>

I could not deduce if this comment was a compliment or an insult. I am not brown, I am from the Middle East, I thought and blurted out, simultaneously. She laughed at me, and told me that I was darker than her. It hit me. I am seen through the melanin of my skin and not through my character. I had thought coming to the United States would free me from all the boxes I was previously packaged in.</p>

This sort of classification of race was unknown to me but I later learned to understand it. I am born and raised in Saudi Arabia and belong to a well-known and well-respected tribe. I have never known what it feels like to be considered, “less than”. I have never been compared to another race. The idea of being called brown does not negatively affect anything in me. However, when I am causally referred to as a terrorist, suspect, extremist, ISIS, jihadi, radical because of my Arab nationality, then brown becomes a compliment.</p>
                            <p class="para p-right">I constantly wondered about the event of 9/11. I wondered if Americans thought we were entertained by the event? Did they believe that we were sipping on tea and laughing at the catastrophe? My answer is no, not one of us was sipping on tea and laughing. In fact, we were deathly scared and felt extreme remorse for the losses of hundreds of lives. I still remember where I was and time when 9/11 occurred. I was 10 years old, attending a sleepover at my best friend’s home. The news channel was on, I watched the replay of the planes crashing in to the World Trade Centers in a fiery blaze. I was terrified.  My best friend’s dad told me to call my mother and tell her to pick me up. The number 911 still haunts me to this day.  Every time I check my phone for the time, I see 9:11. Is it because I only check the time twice a day? Or is it because the number is that significant to remember? I always wonder why do I have to go through the guilt of a crime I never committed?</p>
                            <p class="para p-right">Earlier, when I explained brown becomes a compliment, I meant that I rather be looked down at as “less” rather than be looked at as “dangerous”. Who wants to become friends with a person that is a dangerous? Who would want to trust me? And not think of me as the killer? Whenever I walk down the street, I smile once, and smile once more, begging for acceptance, asking for a second chance. In today’s world, whenever a terrorist attack occurs, Arabs rush to the TV and turn on the news. Silently hoping the terrorist is not an Arab.  Arabs are like canaries in the coal mine, the first to feel the pain. The toxicity of fear is harming us all, Arab or not Arab.</p>

                            <p class="para p-left">After graduating from high school, at the age of 18, I made my first decision ever: to attend college far away from home. After several attempts to get my family on board with my decision to start college someplace other than home, I was finally given the green light.</p>
                            <p class="para p-left">I started searching for a country to attend college in. I knew little about the United States. I had only pictured it through the small screen of my 13-inch-brown-colored HP laptop. I was a visual person and loved watching films especially American films, the ones made in Hollywood.</p>
                            <p class="para p-left">Hollywood films played a huge role in my visual thinking, creating a positive impression of America in my young mind. Through the films I saw a diverse, exciting culture with people from different shapes, backgrounds, and colors. I enjoyed watching American Pie, it made college a fun adventurous destination. I researched several different states in America, and I concluded Oregon to be the state where I would attend college. I did not even know where Oregon was on the map. The only complaint I read about was the downer weather, it rains in Oregon more than any other state. I came from the dry, hot country of Saudi Arabia. I entertained the idea of living in a place where it rains, thinking the great amount of rain would wash away all the fears I had developed over the years from my culture and society.</p>
                            <p class="para p-left">I assumed attending college in the United States would give me a fresh start. Reality was not as pleasant as I had thought it to be. College was not what I had envisioned it to be, dissimilar to the American movies I had watched. A high school graduate, I still did not know the subject to major in. I did know I loved and adored Art. But, Art was not a major that was respected in Saudi Arabia. Saudi families love to brag about their kids’ professions. Most of my uncles were engineers. I was pressured to major in Engineering. I struggled to love Engineering like I loved Art.  I determined majoring in Architecture would be a respectable middle ground between Art and Engineering. I consumed three and half years of my college career creating a vast portfolio, vying to get myself in to the Architecture School at Portland State. I wanted to be the son my parents would be proud of. I was trapped. College started feeling like a marathon race with no finish line. I felt pressured every time someone asked me, “So, when are you graduating?”.  My parents assumed I was messing around and not taking my education seriously. I lost my parent’s trust.  Every time my mother called, she reminded me that nothing would make her happier than watching me walk on the graduation panel wearing the graduation gown. I was doing my best, but Architecture was not my passion.</p>
                            <p class="para p-left">Every year that passed by, I aged a year as well. My classmates had just freshly graduated from high school. Here I was, still trying hard to find my way out of the Architecture program. I smoked my first cigarette during those horrifying years, trying to let go of the anger that was contained in me. Cigarette smoking became a habit, constantly reminding me of those lost college years.</p>

                        <p class="para p-right">Experiencing several downturns in such a short amount of time, I built up anger and sadness towards the world, my family, culture, religion, and finally at myself for being a failure. I was emotionally paralyzed. I had never been the person that opened to others and shared emotions and personal problems. I presented to others that I was strong, but deep inside, I was destroying myself.</p>
                            <p class="para p-right">Slowly, my vision turned dark. The sounds around me became silent. I was upset at the world, and stopped talking. I spent two years of life not talking to anyone. I evaded everyone, isolating myself from the world. I had boxed myself once again, but this time with a demon.  I spent hours and hours on end in my room. I closed myself from all human contact for months at a time, only attending classes and necessary meetings. I packaged myself in a box with depression for two years.</p>
                            <p class="para p-right">The culprit that kept me boxed was unhappiness.  I did not know what I was going to do with my life since I lost all battles to feel a little bit of satisfaction (accomplishment). I dwelled further and further in to the darkness that had consumed me.</p>
                            <p class="para p-right">At the peak of my depression, I forgot the sound of my own voice. I was alone, desperately needing someone to talk to. I scheduled appointments with therapists several times. I cancelled my appointment every time, afraid to admit that I was going crazy. Saudi culture had taught me the crazy ones go to therapists, a cultural stigma. Instead of seeing a therapist, I used my imagination to entertain myself.  I felt as if my eyes had the ability to rotate 360 degrees, rolling back to the inside of my head. I made numerous imaginary characters in my head, I made friends with them.  I did not want to admit that I was alone and unable to find a solution for my problem. I did not want the conversations inside my head to cease, fearing I would lose the ability to speak. I did not know at the time that this experience would lead to a new beginning…</p>
